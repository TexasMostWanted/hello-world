TMW: This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

Hello, I am writing about me!!

This is a second line about me!

I'm adding in spaces to see how that looks.

This is my second branch! 

I misspelled that on line 10!
Here I changed the settings and saw where I can squash my commits.
Third addition just to see the # of commits.
Now I changed the settings back and let's see if the squash option is available!!
